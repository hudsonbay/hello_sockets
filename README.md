# HelloSockets

Basic Elixir - Phoenix WebSocket application for observing how a WebSocket connects and transmits data.

All of this info was taken from the book _Real-Time Phoenix_ by \*\*

### WebSocket Protocol

`https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455`

###Establishing the Connection
Load the HelloSockets webpage by visiting http://localhost:4000. You will see the default generated Phoenix start screen. What we want to see is hiding from us, and weâ€™ll use the DevTools in our browser to view it. You can open the DevTools by `right click > Inspect` on the webpage. There will be a variety of tabs, but we want to select the `Network` tab. Once there, reload the webpage in order to capture the connected WebSocket.

Select the `WS` tab in order to only show WebSocket connections. You are looking for the connection labeled `websocket?token=undefined&vsn=2.0.0`. You may see another connected WebSocket because Phoenix comes with a developer code reloader that operates over a WebSocket, but you can ignore that one.

A WebSocket connection follows this request flow:

1. Initiate a `GET` HTTP(S) connection request to the WebSocket endpoint
2. Receive a `101` or error from the server
3. Upgrade the protocol to WebSocket if `101` is received
4. Send/receive frames over the WebSocket connection

### How to intertact with this application

I implemented `PingChannel` and configured our `Socket` route to send the `ping` topic to our `Channel`. We can use a CLI application to test that our `Channel` works. `wscat` is an npm package that allows for connecting to, sending data to, and receiving data from a WebSocket. It can be a little cumbersome to use but has the advantage of being easy to setup. Use `npm install -g wscat` in order to get started.

####`ping` topic
| Step | Command | Output |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | `$ wscat -c 'ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket?vsn=2.0.0' ` | _connected (press CTRL+C to quit)_ |
| 2 | `["1","1","ping","phx_join",{}]` | _["1","1","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]_ |
| 3 | `["1","2","ping","ping",{}]` | _["1","2","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{"ping":"pong"},"status":"ok"}]_ |

####`wild` topic
The rule for joining this topic is that the last number should double the first number. If not, you can't join.
| Step | Command | Output |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | `$ wscat -c 'ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket?vsn=2.0.0' ` | _connected (press CTRL+C to quit)_ |
| 2 | `["1","1","wild:1:2","phx_join",{}]` | _["1","1","wild:1:2","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]_ |
| 3 | `["1","2","wild:1:2","ping",{}]` | _["1","2","wild:1:2","phx_reply",{"response":{"ping":"pong"},"status":"ok"}]_ |
| 4 | `["1","3","wild:1:3","phx_join",{}]` | _["3","3","wild:1:3","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"error"}]_ |
| 5 | `["1","4","wild:20:40","phx_join",{}]` | _["4","4","wild:20:40","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]_ |
| 6 | `["1","5","wild:2:4:6","phx_join",{}]` | _["5","5","wild:2:4:6","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"error"}]_ |

### Installation

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
